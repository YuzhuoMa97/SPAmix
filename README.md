# SPAmix
A scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework using individual-level allele frequency for large-scale genetic association studies in an admixed population

Please do not hesitate to contact me (yuzhuoma@stu.pku.edu.cn) if you are interested in SPAmix or other retrospective saddlepoint approximation methods desigend for GWAS.

# Introduction of Retrospective saddlepoint approximation (Retrospective SPA) approach in GWAS

Retrospective saddlepoint approximation (Retrospective SPA) is a method applied in GWAS. For a score statistic (S=G^TR), retrospective SPA strategy considers genotypes as random variables and approximate the distribution of score statistics conditional on phenotype and covariates.

Suggestions or comments on retrospective saddlepoint approximation methods are also welcome.

# SPAmix can control for population admixture

In the SPAmix paper (**A scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework using individual-level allele frequency for large-scale genetic association studies in an admixed population**), we proposed SPAmix framework that is applicable to admixed populations and can incorporate local ancestry information into analyses.
